Title: Fitting of generative distribution functions such as galaxy mass functions
Version: 0.2
Author: Danail Obreschkow
Description: This package can find the most likely P-dimensional distribution function (DF) generating N objects with P observables. For instance, if the objects are galaxies, it can fit a MF (P=1), a mass-size distribution (P=2) or the mass-spin-morphology distribution (P=3). Unlike most common fitting approaches, this method accurately accounts for measurement is uncertainties and non-detections and it does not bin the data. A full description of the algorithm can be found in Obreschkow et al. (2017).
